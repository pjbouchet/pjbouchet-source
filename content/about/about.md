I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow within the [Double Mocha](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/mocha/) project led by the [Centre for Research into Ecological & Environmental Modelling (CREEM)](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. In this role, I am designing new methods for predicting behavioural responses of marine mammals to Navy sonar exposure. In 2019, I also worked under CREEM's [DenMod](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/denmod/) project, which focused on developing tools and guidelines for the assessment of extrapolation in predictive models of cetacean populations.

My [research](/research) broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology, and covers an array of marine taxa (fishes, sharks, turtles & cetaceans), habitats (coastal, pelagic), approaches (empirical, simulation, theoretical), scales (local, regional, global), and bioregions (temperate, tropical). 

I always get a kick out of crunching numbers, and have an active interest in the use of GIS and statistical methods to address pressing wildlife conservation problems. In particular, I try to better understand the ecological processes that drive the distribution and abundance of animal populations. My [work](/publications) strives to have a strong applied focus, linking theory with empirical data to improve on-the-ground management and policy decisions as much as possible.

I completed my PhD at the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/) in 2016, where I explored the role of seabed features (e.g. [submarine canyons](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/12/3252)) in aggregating marine megafauna, and helped develop a new generation of [midwater baited underwater video camera systems](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/12/3252) to sample wildlife in offshore habitats.

My primary areas of research include:

- [Model transferability](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(18)30181-2), and the application of predictive models to novel conditions.
- Conservation ecology, e.g. spatial models of [pelagic fish abundance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12619) or [population size estimates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05189-0) for impacted species.
- Ecological sampling techniques, e.g. [field manuals for underwater video surveys](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00177/full).
- Quantitative methods, e.g. standard protocols for species distribution models.

I also act as Associate Editor for [Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation]( http://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2056-3485/) and as Review Editor for the Marine Megafauna section of [Frontiers in Marine Science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science).
