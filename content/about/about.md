Hi! My name is Phil. 

I am a 🇫🇷 quantitative ecologist with an active interest in the use of GIS and statistical methods to address pressing wildlife conservation problems 🐋+🐬+🐟+🦈. I work as a Research Fellow within the [Centre for Research into Ecological & Environmental Modelling (CREEM)](https://www.creem.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews, Scotland.

I always get a kick out of crunching numbers. My research has a strong applied focus and links theory with empirical data to improve on-the-ground management and policy decisions. With support from the U.S. [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)](https://www.boem.gov/), I am currently developing a bioenergetic model to predict the population consequences of disturbance from offshore wind developments on endangered North Atlantic right whales. 

I have recently been involved in the [Double MOCHA ](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/mocha/) project, for which I implemented new Bayesian methods for estimating behavioural responses in marine mammals exposed to naval sonar. In 2019, I was also part of the team behind the [DenMod](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/denmod/) project, which focused on developing tools and guidelines for the [assessment of extrapolation](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13469) in predictive models of wildlife populations. 

I am an Associate Editor for [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210X), and act as Review Editor for [Endangered Species Research](http://www.int-res.com/journals/esr/esr-home/).
