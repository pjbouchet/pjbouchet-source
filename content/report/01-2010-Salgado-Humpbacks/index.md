abstract = "This report comprises the first of three reports prepared for the AMMC (Australian Marine Mammal Centre) with the general aim of assessing the current status of the humpback whale population that migrates along the western Australian coastline each year. The work presented in this report includes the analysis of five years of aerial survey data from North West Cape (NWC) to estimate the population size and trend. Adjoining CWR Report #2010-01 presents a comparison of results from NWC to those from Shark Bay, ~400 km south of NWC, and CMST Report #2010-16 present an analysis of sex ratio data from NWC. The population estimate was based on the application of distance sampling techniques to line transect aerial surveys conducted during 2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008 at NWC. Estimates of group abundance for each survey were computed using a Horvitz-Thompson like estimator. The detection function was then fitted to the data by specifying likelihood of detection at perpendicular distances from the track line. A number of multipliers were then applied to obtain final estimates including, estimated mean group size, time period not surveyed, and a correction factor for availability (and perception bias for 2008). A variety of migration models were trialed. The modeling approach considered to have the most credible assumptions and the best fit was selected. Results from the best models indicated that the humpback whale population size was around 7,276 (CI = 4,993-10,167) in 2000, 10,548 (CI = 6,502-48,622) in 2001, 18,692 (CI = 12,980-24,477) in 2006, 20,044 (CI = 13,815-31,646) in 2007, and 26,100 (CI = 20,152-33,272) in 2008. The trend associated with these estimates that fit the data best was an exponential model with an increase rate of 14.1%. While this increase rate is considered to be above the maximum plausible increase rate of 11.8% (Zerbini et al., 2010), it is not far off from previous estimates of between 10-12%"
