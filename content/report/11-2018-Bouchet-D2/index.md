abstract = "Australiaâ€™s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is the third largest maritime territory in the world. Monitoring its dynamics is fundamental to understanding and reporting on how the ocean is responding to human pressures and global environmental change. Increasingly stringent conservation budgets, however, are placing a strong emphasis on strategic resource allocation. Faced with mounting pressures to build accountability, managers and policy advisors must now more than ever make monitoring investment decisions that are both impactful and cost-effective. This can be challenging given the smorgasbord of modern survey tools currently available, most of which differ widely in costs, capabilities, mobilisation constraints, resolution, or sensitivity, and are evolving rapidly without always being critically evaluated or compared. Whilst pelagic waters present fascinating opportunities for ecological investigation, their extreme horizontal, vertical and temporal patchiness, as well as the huge size range of organisms inhabiting the open ocean, also pose important methodological challenges for sampling. Early pelagic studies relied heavily on capture sampling using nets. While these remain a critical component of biological and oceanographic research today, a rapidly increasing array of innovative technologies (e.g. drifting baited videography, environmental DNA, unmanned aerial vehicles) with various degrees of autonomy and sensory capabilities is revolutionising the way we quantify biophysical processes and observe wildlife in remote habitats. Protocols for choosing optimal combinations of methods for a given region, taxonomic/indicator group, or habitat remain generally unavailable. There is thus an urgent need to synthesise and compare these methods to determine how they can best support and strengthen the empirical evidence base available for implementing marine monitoring programmes. The aim of the present report is to provide a comparative assessment of commonly used pelagic sampling methods. We do this by undertaking a qualitative, yet comprehensive, review of the published literature to identify their potential advantages, limitations, and their relevance to monitoring efforts."
