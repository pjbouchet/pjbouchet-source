abstract = "This report aims to compare recent population estimates of southern hemisphere breeding stock D humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) based on data collected at two key locations along the Western Australian coastline, namely North West Cape (NWC) and Shark Bay, ~400 km south of NWC. The report additionally investigates the efficacy and practicality of current survey designs, and serves as a reference point for future improvement in whale monitoring strategies (location of surveys, field protocols, etc.)."
