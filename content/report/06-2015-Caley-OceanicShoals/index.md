abstract = "The broad continental shelf of northern Australia is characterised by extensive areas of carbonate banks, terraces and isolated pinnacles that provide hard substrates for sponge gardens and associated benthic fauna. The conservation values of these seabed features is recognised in marine bioregional plans through their assignment as Key Ecological Features (KEFs) of regional significance. These KEFs include: the carbonate banks and terraces of the Van Diemen Rise (North Marine Region); the carbonate banks and terraces of the Sahul Shelf (Northwest Marine Region), and; the pinnacles of the Bonaparte Basin (North and Northwest Marine Regions). Previous geological studies provide context for understanding the origin and distribution of modern benthic habitats within the Oceanic Shoals Marine Park. However, significant knowledge gaps around biodiversity patterns remain, with very few field observations of biota made to date in the region. A 25-day collaborative scientific voyage was undertaken by the Marine Biodiversity Hub in 2012 to sample previously unexplored carbonate terraces, banks, and pinnacles. The survey was designed to collect information to generate high-resolution seabed maps, gather samples of benthic biological material, and observe communities of fishes and other vertebrate species."
