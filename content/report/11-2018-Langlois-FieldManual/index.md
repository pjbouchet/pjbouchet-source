abstract = "This benthic stereo-BRUVs Field Manual includes gear designed to acquire imagery of demersal fish assemblages and their habitat within the field of view. A separate manual will address sampling pelagic fish assemblages using BRUVs (Chapter 6). This field manual covers everything required from equipment, pre-survey preparation, field procedures, post-survey procedures and data management for using benthic BRUVs to sample and monitor fish assemblages. The aim is to develop a consistent approach to using this field equipment and allow statistically sound comparisons between studies. Stereo-BRUVs are recommended, over mono-BRUVs, when monitoring demersal fish assemblages. Stereo-BRUVs consist of two cameras strategically and accurately placed on a frame that enable lengths and distance measurements to be made through the use of specialised software. These data are crucial to help monitor changes in fish assemblages over time. Therefore, the following standard operating procedures are written based on the use of stereo video."
