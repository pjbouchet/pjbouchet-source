abstract = "In October 2016, researchers, park managers and a tourist operator interested in the Bremer Bay region came together at the University of Western Australia with the aim of assessing the extent and likely drivers of a megafauna aggregation, including orca Orcinus orca, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas, sperm whales Physeter microcephalus and several shark species that are currently the focus of tourism activities in an area inside and adjacent to the western margin of the Bremer Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR). The Minister for Environment and Energy, the Honourable Josh Frydenberg, committed $100,000 to the National Environmental Science Programmeâ€™s Marine Biodiversity Hub (MBH) to (1) convene a scientific workshop to design a research plan that may help answer these core questions and (2) conduct priority research in a short time frame. The October 2016, workshop participants identified two areas of priority over the short term as relevant to the needs of the Minister, namely determining the the distribution of marine mammals beyond the recognised aggregation and in relation to the Bremer CMR; and developing science communication tools to assist in decision making. Parks Australia offered an additional $50,000 to extend the survey options and communication possibilities. The NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub and Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) supported deployment of a Seaglider at the time of the aggregation. Researchers from numerous institutions including but not exclusive to the University of Western Australia (UWA), Curtin University, Marine Information and Research Group (MIRG) Australia and IMOS, conducted an array of sampling methods from February 2017, with the aim of capturing the key actions identified at the workshop. This report summarises the current outcomes of these research programs."
